## Description
  I have created a program that runs on the terminal that will take in user input and creates a README file.

## How to Use This Application:
  Like I said node is needed to usee this program. You also need to have inquirer installed. To use this program you just need to be inside the file within the terminal and then type "node index.js". Once this is done your readme file should be created after answering the questions.
